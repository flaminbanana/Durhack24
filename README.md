# UK City Tourist Spot Data Dashboard
#### Web Scraping, Data Generation, Data Cleaning and Dashboard
Durhack 2024 Project by Keane Wong, Ryan Chong and Lincoln Kwan

### Project Description

With the theme of exploration, we as a team though about the cities/towns we are studying in, London, Manchester and Durham. Even though we have visited each other a few times, we have not really explored each other's cities. We thought about how tourists need to gather a lot of information if they want to stay in a particular city/town so we decided to make a tool that can make it easier.

This tool compiles data scraped from google maps and google travel and presents them in a table in which users can copy and paste from. Users could also enter coordinates of tourist spots and generate google maps links for either the location itself or directions going from one location to another.

The data can also be sorted based on factors such as price, review rating, number of reviews etc.


### Initialisation

To run the app, open the respository on your command line and run:

`python3 run.py`

A 1600x900 window would be opened and you can access the dashboard there.

### Fitting in the Theme

As the theme is about exploration, we decided to take it both literally and figuratively,. The former by themeing our project on exploring each other's cities or towns and the latter by using and learning new libraries and skills. Examples include using TKinter for the dashboard instead of using something simpler like a website (HTML) interface which we already know, and data scraping sites with dynamic javascript using selenium.

### Python Libraries Used:

TKinter, pandas, numpy, requests, urllib, selenium, beaufitul soup
